PHOTO-DIR names a directory containing .jpeg files named after

  inserted into entries.

ORG-FILE names an existing Org file to merge the entries into.

CONFLICTS is a symbol specifying the strategy for dealing with
  UUID conflicts between existing entries in the Org file and
  entries being imported (based on the DAYONE_UUID property).  Should
  be either `skip' or `replace'.  Defaults to `skip'.

OLP specifies an `org-capture'-style outline path to an existing
  headline under which the datetree should be inserted
  (e.g. `(\"Journals\" \"Day One\")'.  Import will abort if matching
  headline cannot be found.  If nil, datetree will be inserted at the
